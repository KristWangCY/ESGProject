# ESGAnalyticsProject
This project is focusing on analyzing US_emission dataset.  
The raw dataset is Limit to U.S Public Traded Companies, collected from - https://carbonmajors.org/  
The dataset provides high-granularity emissions data and financial performance indicators for major publicly traded companies.  
The key aspects of the dataset include:   
Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions from company operations, including fuel use, flaring, and venting) & Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions from sold products, reflecting reliance on carbon offsets).  
Company financial metrics from Yahoo Finance, like market capitalisation, price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, and return on equity (ROE).  
ESG scores from external data sources.  
Corporate net-zero pledges (Example: Shell has the target set for 2050).  

# Problem Statement  
CO₂ Emissions, ESG Performance, and Net-Zero Commitments: Examining Corporate Sustainability and Market Performance  
Dataset Overview: Limit to U.S Public Traded Companies  
1. Do higher CO₂ emissions correlate with stronger stock market performance for publicly traded high-emission companies?
2. Are corporate net-zero pledges realistic based on historical emissions trends?
3. Are companies making real Scope 1 reductions, or are they relying on Scope 3 offsets (potential greenwashing)?
